Click `Run in Postman`\n\n3. Click `Postman for Windows`\n\n4. If prompted, click `Open Postman`\n\n5. After a moment, you should see a toast notification saying that the **Users (Okta API)** collection was successfully imported.\n\n6.

First hover over the `{{url}}` environment variable at the top of the request window. Verify that you see your Okta URL.\n\n2. Next, look at the URI (relative to our base Okta URL) of the request endpoint: `/api/v1/users` This is the relative URI for all requests in this collection, though some requests may require additional URI parameters or query strings.\n\n2. Observe that this request has a boolean `activate` URI parameter. When `activate` is set to true, this request will create a user with the status of `ACTIVE`\n\n3. Finally, notice that this request uses the HTTP `POST` method. This method is used when creating a new web resource, in this case, an Okta User."

The `Accept` header communicates what type of data our client (Postman) can accept back in a response from Okta. Here, we accept `application/json` data.\n\n4. The `Content-Type` header communicates the type of data we are sending in our request to Okta. This is also `application/json` data."

Recall that we created a **Group Rule** in `Lab 1.2` that will automatically add a user with `userType` **customer** to our **Customers** group.\n\nThe `Credentials` object will be left unchanged.\n\nYour updated request body will be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"profile\": {\n  \"firstName\": \"Samus\",\n  \"lastName\": \"Aran\",\n  \"email\": \"samus.aran@{{email-suffix}}\",\n  \"login\": \"samus.aran@{{email-suffix}}\",\n  \"userType\": \"customer\",\n  \"nickName\": \"Sammy\"\n},\n\"credentials\": {\n    \"password\" : { \"value\": \"{{password}}\" }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n(You can ignore the **Insert Code** link above and simply copy and paste the JSON into the request body in Postman)"

If you scroll down, you will find the `Profile` object you specified.\n\n6. You will also see a `Credentials` object, but the password is not echoed back.\n\n7.
