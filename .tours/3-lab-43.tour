A partial update means we only provide the data for the profile attributes we want to update.\n\nAlternatively, the `PUT` method can be used for a complete update. This would mean that any attribute values that are not specified in the request body will be deleted from the user's profile.\n\nFor our purposes, we will use the `POST` method for a partial update."

Since we are performing a partial update, we only need to specify this attribute in the Profile object of our JSON payload:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"profile\": {\n  \"lastName\": \"Nara\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n1. **Ignore the Insert code link above** and just copy and paste it into the body of your request.\n\n\n2.
